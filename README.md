# Leverage Power of Machine Learning with ONNX


Have you ever wanted to make your apps “smarter”? This session will cover what every ML/AI developer should know about Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) . Why it’s important and how it can reduce friction in incorporating machine learning models to your apps. We will show how to train models using the framework of your choice, save or convert models into ONNX, and deploy to cloud and edge using a high-performance runtime.

The sample app is using ML.NET to generate ONNX file and use it for infencing

Try it out in Jupyter Notebook with C# Kernel.
